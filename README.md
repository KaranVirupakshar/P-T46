Study Buddy

Studying often works best in a group setting. It’s a means of holding yourself
accountable. But it’s not always possible to find people of similar interests. Using Study
Buddy, you can find the study groups that interest you and meet regularly at scheduled
times to maintain a routine. You can join a group that shares a similar field of study,
common interests, or local area to you.

Study Buddy makes collaborative learning easy. With the Study Buddy Study Groups
app, you can not only learn about the subject that you choose but also discuss your
classes, queries, assignments, and more. It is like a student social network app to help
students learn better and learn smarter.
